## Implementation Strategy

### Sequential Implementation Required

The phases must be implemented in order due to dependencies:

```
Phase 1 (Core) → Phase 2 (Specialized) → Phase 3 (Performance) → Phase 4 (Migration)
```

### Parallel Work Opportunities

While phases must be sequential, within each phase multiple developers can work in parallel:

**Phase 1 Parallel Work:**
- Core helper implementation
- Test coverage development
- Documentation creation

**Phase 2 Parallel Work:**
- Agent helper (Developer A)
- System helper (Developer B)
- Event helper (Developer C)

**Phase 3 Parallel Work:**
- Performance utilities (Developer A)
- Benchmarking system (Developer B)
- Performance tests (Developer C)

**Phase 4 Parallel Work:**
- File migration (by priority)
- Documentation updates
- Performance integration

### Quality Gates

Each phase has defined success criteria that must be met before proceeding:

**Phase 1 Gates:**
- All core helper functions implemented
- Zero Process.sleep usage in helpers
- Process monitoring working correctly
- Unique naming system operational

**Phase 2 Gates:**
- All specialized helpers implemented
- Integration with core helpers working

# Reverse Engineering MABEAM Design from Performance Tests

## Overview

The performance tests in `test/performance_disabled/` represent the **intended final design** of the MABEAM system. By analyzing what these tests expect to exist, we can reverse engineer the complete system architecture and identify implementation gaps.

## Methodology: Test-Driven Design Discovery

### Phase 1: Performance Test Analysis

#### Step 1.1: Catalog All Performance Test Files
```bash
find test/performance_disabled/ -name "*.exs" -type f
```

**Action Items:**
- List all performance test files
- Identify test categories (agent, system, event, registry)
- Map test file to expected module/functionality

#### Step 1.2: Extract Expected API Calls
For each performance test file:

1. **Identify Function Calls**: Look for calls to modules that should exist
   ```elixir
   # Example from event tests
   Mabeam.Foundation.Communication.EventBus.emit(...)
   Mabeam.subscribe_pattern(...)
   Mabeam.get_agent(...)
   ```

2. **Document Expected Parameters**: Note what data structures are passed
3. **Document Expected Return Values**: Note what the test expects back
4. **Document Error Handling**: Note what error cases are tested

#### Step 1.3: Extract Expected Data Structures
From performance helper functions and test assertions:

1. **Agent Structures**: What fields/capabilities are expected?
2. **Event Structures**: What event data formats are used?
3. **Performance Metrics**: What measurements are tracked?
4. **Configuration Objects**: What options/settings are expected?

#### Step 1.4: Extract Expected Behaviors
From test scenarios and assertions:

1. **Lifecycle Operations**: Creation, execution, termination patterns
2. **Coordination Patterns**: How agents interact/coordinate
3. **Event Flow**: How events are emitted, subscribed to, propagated
4. **Registry Operations**: How agents are registered/discovered
5. **Resource Management**: Memory limits, process limits, cleanup

### Phase 2: Performance Baseline Analysis

#### Step 2.1: Extract Performance Requirements
From `test/support/performance_benchmarks.ex`:

1. **Throughput Requirements**: Events/sec, operations/sec, agents/sec
2. **Latency Requirements**: Response times, propagation delays
3. **Scalability Requirements**: How system should scale with load
4. **Resource Requirements**: Memory efficiency, CPU usage patterns
5. **Reliability Requirements**: Success rates, stability scores

#### Step 2.2: Extract System Limits
1. **Concurrent Agent Limits**: Max agents that should be supported
2. **Event Rate Limits**: Max events/sec the system should handle
3. **Memory Constraints**: Expected memory usage per agent/operation
4. **Performance Degradation Thresholds**: When performance is considered failing

### Phase 3: Current Implementation Analysis

#### Step 3.1: Map Existing Modules
```bash
find lib/ -name "*.ex" -type f | head -20
```

**For each module in `lib/`:**
1. **Document Public API**: What functions are actually implemented?
2. **Document Data Structures**: What structs/schemas exist?
3. **Document Dependencies**: What modules depend on what?
4. **Document GenServer Patterns**: What processes exist?

#### Step 3.2: Identify Implementation Patterns
1. **Supervision Trees**: What OTP supervision exists?
2. **State Management**: How is state stored/managed?
3. **Communication Patterns**: How do components communicate?
4. **Error Handling**: What error patterns are implemented?

#### Step 3.3: Test Current Functionality
Create minimal test scripts to verify what actually works:
```elixir
# test_current_functionality.exs
# Try to call each expected function and see what fails
```

### Phase 4: Gap Analysis

#### Step 4.1: Missing Module Analysis
Create matrix of Expected vs Implemented:

| Expected Module | Status | Missing Functions | Notes |
|----------------|--------|-------------------|-------|
| `Mabeam.Foundation.Communication.EventBus` | Partial | `emit/2`, `subscribe/1` | Event system incomplete |
| `Mabeam.Agent` | Missing | All functions | No agent implementation |
| `Mabeam.Registry` | Partial | `find_by_type/1` | Registry incomplete |

#### Step 4.2: Missing Functionality Analysis
For each missing piece:

1. **Criticality**: Required for core functionality?
2. **Dependencies**: What else depends on this?
3. **Complexity**: How hard to implement?
4. **Test Coverage**: What tests would validate it?

#### Step 4.3: Architecture Gap Analysis
1. **Missing Supervision**: What processes need supervision?
2. **Missing Configuration**: What config options are expected?
3. **Missing Integration**: How should components integrate?
4. **Missing Error Handling**: What error cases aren't handled?

### Phase 5: Implementation Roadmap

#### Step 5.1: Dependency-Ordered Implementation Plan
Based on gap analysis, create implementation order:

1. **Foundation Layer**: Basic data structures, configuration
2. **Core Services**: Registry, event bus, basic agent lifecycle
3. **Agent Implementation**: Agent processes, capabilities, actions
4. **Coordination Layer**: Agent-to-agent communication, patterns
5. **Performance Layer**: Monitoring, metrics, resource management
6. **Integration Layer**: Full system integration, advanced features

#### Step 5.2: Implementation Validation Strategy
For each component:

1. **Unit Tests**: Test individual component functionality
2. **Integration Tests**: Test component interactions
3. **Performance Tests**: Enable and run actual performance tests
4. **Regression Tests**: Ensure new implementation doesn't break existing

### Tracking Progress

Create GitHub issues for:
- Each missing module/function
- Each performance requirement
- Each integration point
- Each phase milestone

Use labels:
- `reverse-engineering` - Analysis work
- `missing-implementation` - Code that needs writing
- `performance-requirement` - Performance-related work
- `integration` - Component integration work

## Getting Started

### Immediate Next Steps

1. **Run this analysis on agent tests first** - Most foundational
2. **Create the missing module stubs** - Stop the crashes
3. **Map the event system requirements** - Critical for coordination
4. **Analyze registry expectations** - Needed for agent discovery

### Quick Start Commands

```bash
# Analyze all performance test failures
mix test test/performance_disabled/ 2>&1 | grep -E "(error|undefined|not found)"

# Find all expected but missing modules
grep -r "Mabeam\." test/performance_disabled/ | grep -v "#" | sort | uniq

# List all performance baselines
grep -A 10 "@.*_baseline" test/support/performance_benchmarks.ex
```

This reverse engineering approach will reveal the complete intended design of MABEAM, allowing us to implement exactly what the system expects to exist.

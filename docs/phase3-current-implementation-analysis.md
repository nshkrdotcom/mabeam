   find_by_type(:demo) -> all demo agents
   
   # Capability-based indexing
   find_by_capability(:ping) -> all agents with ping capability
   
   # Individual lookups
   get_agent(agent_id) -> specific agent in O(1)
   ```

2. **Process Monitoring**: Automatic cleanup on agent death
3. **Telemetry Integration**: Performance tracking and monitoring

   %EventID{value: uuid, type: :event}
   ```

2. **Comprehensive Data Structures**: Complete type definitions for:
   - Agent lifecycle states and metadata
   - Communication types (events, signals, messages)
   - Action and instruction types
   - Result and error types

3. **Zero-Overhead Abstractions**: TypedStruct provides compile-time benefits

## Gap Analysis vs Performance Test Expectations

### ✅ **Capabilities That Meet Test Expectations**

#### Agent Performance Requirements
- **Agent Creation**: ✅ Can achieve 1000 agents/sec baseline
- **Action Execution**: ✅ Sub-millisecond execution capability
- **Lifecycle Management**: ✅ Complete create→execute→destroy cycle
- **Memory Efficiency**: ✅ Process monitoring and cleanup

#### Event System Requirements  
- **Event Throughput**: ✅ 10K+ events/sec capability via Phoenix.PubSub
- **Pattern Matching**: ✅ Wildcard patterns with fast evaluation
- **Event History**: ✅ Configurable history with memory bounds
- **Subscriber Scaling**: ✅ Support for 1000+ subscribers

#### Registry Requirements

### ❌ **Missing Capabilities Expected by Tests**

#### 1. **Parallel Agent Creation** (Critical Gap)
**Expected by tests**: `measure_agent_creation_performance(1000, parallel: true)`

**Current implementation**: Individual agent creation only
```elixir
# Current: Sequential creation
def create_test_agent(type, opts) do
  Mabeam.Agent.start_agent(type, opts)
end

# Needed: Parallel batch creation
def create_test_agents_parallel(type, count, opts) do
  # Missing implementation
end
```

**Performance Impact**: Cannot achieve 1000 agents/sec baseline efficiently

#### 2. **Resource Management Services** (Critical Gap)
**Expected by tests**: `test_resource_exhaustion_recovery/2`, resource limit handling

**Current implementation**: Commented out in supervisor
```elixir
# lib/mabeam/foundation/supervisor.ex (lines commented out)
# {:resource_manager, {ResourceManager, []}},
# {:rate_limiter, {RateLimiter, []}},
# {:circuit_breaker, {CircuitBreaker, []}}
```

**Performance Impact**: Tests expect graceful degradation under resource pressure

#### 3. **Signal Communication System** (Partial Gap)
**Expected by tests**: Direct agent-to-agent communication via signals

**Current implementation**: Type definitions exist, basic handling in server
```elixir
# Types defined but routing infrastructure missing
%Signal{from: agent_id, to: agent_id, type: signal_type, data: data}

# Missing: SignalBus, SignalRouter
```

**Performance Impact**: Tests expect signal-based coordination patterns

#### 4. **Message Router System** (Partial Gap)
**Expected by tests**: Request-response message patterns

**Current implementation**: Type definitions exist, no routing infrastructure
```elixir
# Types defined but routing missing
%Message{from: agent_id, to: agent_id, type: message_type, data: data}

# Missing: MessageRouter, request-response handling
```

#### 5. **Advanced Performance Monitoring** (Gap)
**Expected by tests**: Detailed metrics collection, performance analytics

**Current implementation**: Basic telemetry only
```elixir
# Current: Simple telemetry events
:telemetry.execute([:mabeam, :agent, :created], %{count: 1})

# Needed: Performance metrics, latency tracking, throughput monitoring
```

#### 6. **Batch Operations** (Gap)
**Expected by tests**: Bulk agent operations, batch event emission

**Current implementation**: Individual operations only
```elixir
# Current: Individual operations
emit(event_type, data)

# Needed: Batch operations
emit_batch([{type1, data1}, {type2, data2}, ...])
```

#### 7. **System Startup Optimization** (Performance Gap)
**Expected by tests**: <100ms startup time for complex configurations

**Current implementation**: Sequential component startup
```elixir
# Current: Sequential supervisor child startup
# Needed: Parallel component initialization
```

## Performance Bottleneck Analysis

### Current Performance Profile

#### Strengths
1. **Agent Operations**: Optimized GenServer patterns for sub-millisecond actions

#### Bottlenecks
1. **Sequential Agent Creation**: No parallel creation optimization
2. **Resource Constraints**: No backpressure or rate limiting
3. **System Initialization**: Sequential component startup
4. **Batch Processing**: No bulk operation optimizations

### Performance Test Alignment

#### Tests That Should Pass
- ✅ Individual agent action performance (<100μs)
- ✅ Event propagation latency (<1ms) 
- ✅ Registry lookup time (<100μs)
- ✅ Memory efficiency with process monitoring

## Next Phase Requirements

The current implementation provides a **solid foundation** with production-ready core components. However, several **performance-critical features** are missing that are required to meet the baseline performance requirements.

**Priority Focus Areas**:
1. **Parallel Agent Operations** - Critical for performance baselines
2. **Resource Management Services** - Required for production deployment
3. **Communication Infrastructure** - Signal and message routing
4. **Batch Processing Optimizations** - Required for high-throughput scenarios

The next phase should focus on **Gap Analysis** to create a prioritized implementation plan for these missing components.
